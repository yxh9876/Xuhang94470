# Outline
## High-level summary
The United States and China started the trade war in 2018. This project will inspect the trade war's impact on various aspects of these two countries and prove that it has caused a lose-lose situation.


## Project structure
1. a timeline visualization of important events in the trade war. 
2. visualization of changes in the volume of bilateral trade between China and the United States
3. visualization of various macroeconomic indicators that help check whether the trade war has served the initial goals of President Donald Trump. Mr Trump's tariffs policy aims to encourage consumers to buy American products by making imported goods more expensive
4. visualization of the trade war's effects on people's life in the two countries, such as CPI
5. my final conclusion of analysis (in words)

# Data source
## Documentation and explanation

I will use only credible data sources like websites of goverments, think tanks and economics research institutes. These sources will provide credible and open source data for trade-related topics.

In detail, the data source include United States Census Bureau, The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Bureau of Statistics of China and Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics. I might also use data from websites like tradingeconomics.com and investing.com.

# Method and medium
I am planning to use and only use Shorthand to create a web page that tells the story. I will also be using Tableau and other data visualization tools to create the visualization plots.

In the created webpage, all the five sections that I mentioned in the project structure will be presented in sequence.
