# User research and interviews
## Target Audience
The target audience is mainly the congressman of the US and all the American people who are interested in this topic.

On Feb 7, a bipartisan group of 41 senators urged President Joe Bidenâ€™s trade chief to create a more comprehensive process to exclude some Chinese imports from punitive tariffs that the lawmakers say have a negative impact on U.S. businesses. I am creating a shorthand webpage to tell the story that urges people pause or even stop the US-Sino trade war is reasonable.


## approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
Unfortunately, I don't hava the connection to any congressman in the US. So, I will instead interview some CMU students, who are educated as congressmen. The interviewee should care for political topics like this and have the basic knowledge about it.

So, I will reach out to some of the students at CMU, who are diversified in race, gender and age. 

## interview script
First, I will introduce briefly the basics of my project and what the interview is about.

"Hello. Thank you for accepting the interview. This is a dataviz project that I'm doing to persuade the US congressmen and general public that the US pause or even stop the US-Sino trade war because it is not working." 

Then I will ask the following questions.

1. What do you think of the overall structure and logic of this dataviz project?
2. What about the plots and graphs? What do you think of the dataviz?
3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
4. Is there anything you would change interms of looking, aesthetics?
5. What other suggestions do you have for me?

Color of the dates in the timeline infoviz?


Red and green to represent escalations and de-escalations? But red is like China. Where to put legends for red and green?

What about all the same color? Isn't that too monotonous?

| What do you think of the overall structure and logic of this dataviz project?  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| What about the plots and graphs? What do you think of the dataviz?  | Maybe there are two many colors used across the various plots. And the colors are not consitent in different plots. In one plot you used green and in another you used orange, but they didn't make sense to me.  | In the timeline visualization, there are many different colors for the dates. Why is it so? What is it telling?  | Content Cell  |
| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | Content Cell  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Is there anything you would change interms of looking, aesthetics?  | Content Cell  | You might put the charts in the center of the webpage, not in the left side of the page. | Content Cell  |
| What other suggestions do you have for me? | Content Cell  | Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
