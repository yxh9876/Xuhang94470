# Target audience
The target audience is mainly the congressman of the US and all the American people who are interested in this topic.

On Feb 7, a bipartisan group of 41 senators urged President Joe Biden’s trade chief to create a more comprehensive process to exclude some Chinese imports from punitive tariffs that the lawmakers say have a negative impact on U.S. businesses. I am creating a shorthand webpage to tell the story that urges people pause or even stop the US-Sino trade war is reasonable.



# Changes that I made since the completion of Part 2
1. Resize the plots to make them suit the Shorthand page.
2. Reorder the plots and put the slope chart at the first.
3. Set a simple and consistent color tone across the project and stick to those few colors. Also, I should use meaningful colors.
4. Wrote my conclusion at the first page of the project as subtitle to help readers understand easier.
5. Improve the timeline visualization, especially the color of the dates.
6. Split the the trade volume and deficit into two graphs. One is trade volume and the second is trade deficit. Moreover, I changed the trade deficit plot from bar chart to line chart.
7. In the shorthand page, highlight the key words in paragraphs with red and golden color to emphasize the important words.
8. In the timeline visualization, highlight the key words in paragraphs with red.
9. In the line charts, make the fonts of events caption larger so that the viewers can see them more easily.

The design decisions that I made was to distinguish what really matters to the target audience. Dataviz is about telling a story to the audience, so you have to know your audience and give them what they need/like and what you want them to know. In this project, the changes that I made was mostly to highlight what might intrigue the audience and also replace what might distract the audience. For example, I made the keywords in the paragraphs red and the most important conclusion golden to let the audience notice. In contrast, I deleted some unnecessary colors which didn't convey any meanings to avoid distracting the audience.

To summarize, the most important thing that I learned during this project was to know your audience and attract them with your dataviz.
