# Step one: find a data visualization
## The chart I chose
IC3 Complaint Statistics 2014-2018 
from the report "2018 INTERNET CRIME REPORT"
https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2018_IC3Report.pdf

## The reason 

I am choosing this chart. I looked through several articles and this visualization cauught my attention suddenly, There is a globe in the background. Apparently, the author wanted to create something special. However, after analyzing it carefully, I realized that there are big problems about this visualization, so I chose this one.

# Step two: critique the data visualization
## How does this method compare to the Good Charts method? 
This method is a more comprehensive one compared to the good charts method. This method consists of both informative and emotive aspects. The Good Charts method focuses more on the visual aspect of a chart, and it does involve more detailed questinons about the visual aspect of a chart. However, this method also focus on the information aspect of a chart, for instance, usefulness and completeness of the data.

After doing this critique, I realized that the chart is showing very useful data to the report readers, but the problem is that there are too much unuseful visual elements in the chart, like the globe in the background and the arrow on the top. Less is more. In my redesign, I am going to eliminate those elements and show only what is necessary to convey the information to the audience.

# Step 4
## First Interviewee
- Can you tell me what you think this is?

The interviewee first asked what is IC3, and then interpreted #complaints and losses as the complaints it received and the losses of IC3. Without the context of the original report, the interviewee misunderstood the title and the data. 

I explained to her what the data really meant, which took quite a few questions. This suggests that this plot depends a lot on the original report.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

The interviewee could see that the number of complaints IC3 received and losses were increasing every year.


- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

2 y-axis in the same plot is quite surprising to her. The interviewee first wondered why I used line chart for losses and bar chart for complaints, but then thought it made sense, because one is above the other. This design is better than using line chart for both data or using bar chart for both data.

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

The department in charge of internet crimes.

- Which one do you prefer? Is there anything you would change or do differently?

If there is some kind of correlation or other relationship, the first design is better. Otherwise, the second design is better. She said that she definitely prefer the first design. The first sketch is good-looking and there is nothing she wanted to add to it.

## Second Interviewee
- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Which one do you prefer? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
