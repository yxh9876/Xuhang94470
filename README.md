# About me
My name is Xuhang Yang, and it pronounces like "Shyu-hang Yang". My gender pronoun is he/him/his.  
I am a second year MISM-BIDA student. I am really interested in various aspects of data science, including data visualization. I have taken a few courses about data manipulation, machine learning, etc. And I think what I really need now is a data visualization course, just like 94470.


# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn some theoratical knowledge about data visualization, especially how to make my visualization clearer and more persuasive. Also, I hope to gain some hands-on experience from the assignments of this course.  
After graduation, I'll be working at the headquater of a commercial bank called [ICBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_and_Commercial_Bank_of_China) in China.
