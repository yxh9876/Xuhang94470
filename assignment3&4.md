## First Interviewee
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
The interviewee first asked what is IC3, and then interpreted #complaints and losses as the complaints it received and the losses of IC3. Without the context of the original report, the interviewee misunderstood the title and the data. 

I explained to her what the data really meant, which took quite a few questions. This suggests that this plot depends a lot on the original report.




- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
The interviewee could see that the number of complaints and losses were increasing every year.


- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Which one do you prefer? Is there anything you would change or do differently?
