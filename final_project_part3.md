## Changes that I made since the completion of Part 2
1. Resize the plots to make them suit the Shorthand page.
2. Reorder the plots and put the slope chart at the first.
3. Set a simple and consistent color tone across the project and stick to those few colors. Also, I should use meaningful colors.
4. Wrote my conclusion at the first page of the project as subtitle to help readers understand easier.
5. Improve the timeline visualization, especially the color of the dates.
6. Split the the trade volume and deficit into two graphs. One is trade volume and the second is trade deficit. Moreover, I changed the trade deficit plot from bar chart to line chart.
7. Highlight the key words in paragraphs with red and golden color to emphasize the important words.
8. In the line charts, make the fonts of events caption larger so that the viewers can see them more easily.
