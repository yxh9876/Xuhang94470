# Outline
## High-level summary


## Project structure

# Initial sketches

When thinking about your topic, take time to think about what you want to say, to whom, and why. 
Ensuring access to data is really important.  Make sure you establish in Part I that you truly have access to the data you'll need in order to complete the project.  More on that later. 


# Data source
## Documentation and explanation

I am planning to use the open source data from the government website of the United States.

## Link to the publicly-accessible datasets

Import, export, deficit percentage (U.S.-China to all of U.S.)


# Method and medium
I am planning to use Shorthand to create a web page that tells the story. I will also be using Tableau and other data visualization tools to create the visualization plots.
