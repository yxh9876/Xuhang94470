# Target Audience
On Feb 7, a bipartisan group of 41 senators urged President Joe Bidenâ€™s trade chief to create a more comprehensive process to exclude some Chinese imports from punitive tariffs that the lawmakers say have a negative impact on U.S. businesses. I am creating a shorthand webpage to tell the story that the urge to pause or even stop the US-Sino trade war is reasonable. The target audience is mainly the congressman of the US and any other American public interested in this topic.

Color of the dates in the timeline infoviz?

Red and green to represent escalations and de-escalations? But red is like China. Where to put legends for red and green?

What about all the same color? Isn't that too monotonous?
